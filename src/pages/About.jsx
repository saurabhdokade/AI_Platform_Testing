            CEH Point is an AI-driven learning platform designed to help
            individuals from any domain generate courses, engage in
            self-learning, complete projects, and earn certifications by

            offered a two-month internship, followed by further training and job
            opportunities. Our mission is to empower college students and
            graduates with essential skills through project-based learning,
            hands-on assessments, and personalized training that bridge the gap
            between education and employment. By leveraging cutting-edge tools,
            we aim to prepare individuals for the tech-driven job market,
            fostering a generation of professionals ready to excel in their

            professionals can learn, build practical projects, and enhance their
            skills independently. After earning a certification, our company
            offers a two-month unpaid internship with mentorship and support.
            Upon successful completion of the internship, candidates will
            undergo a four-month training program with a stipend. Those who
            complete the training will have the opportunity for full-time
            employment with us, creating a remarkable journey from fresher to
            skilled employee.
